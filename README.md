# 🌾 Weather Prediction API for Crop Yield Optimization

## 🎓 Final Semester Project - M.Sc. in Computer Science

This project was developed as part of our final semester for the Master's program in Computer Science. Our team of five set out to build a Weather Prediction API/AI system that provides weather forecasts for specific districts to assist in crop yield planning and agricultural decision-making.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict weather conditions** (such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, etc.) in a given district using **machine learning** and **weather data APIs**, to support **agriculture planning** and **crop yield optimization**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Agricultural productivity is highly dependent on weather conditions. Farmers and agricultural planners often face difficulty in anticipating future weather patterns, which can negatively impact crop yields. Our system aims to solve this problem by:

- Providing accurate weather predictions.
- Assisting in crop selection and planting decisions.
- Reducing risks related to unexpected weather events.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

We developed a RESTful API powered by machine learning models trained on historical weather and crop yield data. The system allows users to:

- Input a district name.
- Receive predicted weather data (e.g., rainfall, temperature, humidity).
- Optionally view suggested crop types best suited for the upcoming season based on the forecast.
